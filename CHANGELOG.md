# Changelog

All notable changes to the Mottainai Survey App will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.4] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Sync Status Display Bug**: Fixed issue where pickups showed as "Pending" in history screen even after successful sync to backend
  - Added automatic history reload when sync completes
  - History screen now listens for sync completion and refreshes pickup list
  - Users now see correct "Completed" status immediately after sync
  - No backend changes required - display issue only
  - Files modified: `lib/screens/history_screen.dart`

### Technical Details
- Root cause: History screen wasn't reloading after background sync completion
- Solution: Added `SyncProvider` listener to history screen that triggers reload when `isSyncing` changes to `false`
- Impact: Improved user experience, reduced confusion about sync status
- See `MOBILE_APP_SYNC_BUG_FIX.md` for detailed analysis
